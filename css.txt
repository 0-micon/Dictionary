selector
	1. The element Selector
		selects elements based on the element name.
		p { text-align: center; color: red; }
	2. The id Selector
		uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
	To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
		#para1 { text-align: center; color: red; }
	Note: An id name cannot start with a number!
	3. The class Selector
		selects elements with a specific class attribute.
	To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.
		.center { text-align: center; color: red; }
	You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.
		p.center { text-align: center; color: red; }
	HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.
		<p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>
	Note: A class name cannot start with a number!
	4. Grouping Selectors
	To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.
		h1, h2, p { text-align: center; color: red; }
comment
	A CSS comment starts with /* and ends with */. Comments can also span multiple lines.
		p { color: red; /* This is a comment */ text-align: center; }
link
	1. External Style Sheet
	A page must include a reference to the external CSS-file inside the <link> element. The <link> element goes inside the <head> section.
		<head><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css"></head>
	The CSS-file should not contain any html tags. The style sheet file must be saved with a .css extension.
	2. Internal Style Sheet
	Internal styles are defined within the <style> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page.
		<head><style>body { background-color: linen; }</style></head>
	3. Inline Styles
	To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
		<h1 style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;">This is a heading.</h1>
	Tip: An inline style loses many of the advantages of a style sheet (by mixing content with presentation). Use this method sparingly!
	4. Multiple Style Sheets
	If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used.
	Generally speaking we can say that all the styles will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:
	1) Inline style (inside an HTML element)
	2) External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
	3) Browser default
	So, an inline style (inside a specific HTML element) has the highest priority, which means that it will override a style defined inside the <head> tag, or in an external style sheet, or a browser default value.
color
	1. Color Names
	HTML and CSS supports 140 standard color names.
		http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp
	Note: Color names are case-insensitive: "Red" is the same as "red" or "RED".
	2. RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
	Each parameter (red, green, blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.
		rgb(255,255,0) is displayed as yellow
	3. Hexadecimal Colors
	RGB values are specified using hexadecimal color values in the form: #RRGGBB, where RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and FF (same as decimal 0-255).
		#FF0000 is displayed as red
	Note: HEX values are case-insensitive: "#ff0000" is the same as "FF0000".
background
	1. Background Color
	The background-color property specifies the background color of an element.
		body { background-color: lightblue; }
	2. Background Image
	The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.
		body { background-image: url("paper.gif"); }
	By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element. To repeat an image vertically, set background-repeat: repeat-y; To show the background image only once, set background-repeat: no-repeat;
	The position of the image is specified by the background-position property.
		body { background-image: url("tree.png"); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: right top; }
	To specify that the background image should be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page), use the background-attachment property.
		body { background-image: url("tree.png"); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: right top; background-attachment: fixed; }
	To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property. The shorthand property for background is background.
		body { background: #ffffff url("tree.png") no-repeat right top; }
	When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:
	1) background-color,
	2) background-image,
	3) background-repeat,
	4) background-attachment,
	5) background-position
	It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order.
border
	1. Border Style
	The border-style property specifies what kind of border to display. The following values are allowed: dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset, none, hidden.
	When using the border-style property the order of the border sides is:
	1) one value: (top and right and bottom and left);
		p.one {border-style: dotted;}
	2) two values: (top and bottom), (right and left);
		p.two {border-style: dotted dashed;}
	3) three values: top, (right and left), bottom;
		p.three {border-style: dotted dashed solid;}
	4) four values: top, right, bottom, left.
		p.mix {border-style: dotted dashed solid double;}
	2. Border Width
	The border-width property specifies the width of the four borders. The width can be set as a specific size (in px, pt, cm, em, etc) or by using one of the three pre-defined values: thin, medium, or thick. The border-width property can have from one to four values (top, right, bottom, left).
		p.three { border-style: solid; border-width: 2px 10px 4px 20px; }
	3. Border Color
	The border-color property is used to set the color of the four borders. The border-color property can have from one to four values (top, right, bottom, left). If border-color is not set, it inherits the color of the element.
		p.three { border-style: solid; border-color: red green blue yellow; }
	4. Individual Sides
	In CSS, there is also properties for specifying each of the borders (top, right, bottom, and left): border-top-style, border-right-style, border-bottom-style, border-left-style.
		p { border-style: dotted solid; }
	5. Shorthand Property
	To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the individual border properties in one property. The border property is a shorthand property for the following individual border properties:
	1) border-width,
	2) border-style (required),
	3) border-color
		p { border: 5px solid red; }
	You can also specify all the individual border properties for just one side.
		p { border-left: 6px solid red; }
		p { border-bottom: 6px solid red; }
	6. Rounded Borders
	The border-radius property is used to add rounded borders to an element.
		p { border: 2px solid red; border-radius: 5px; }
margin
	The margin properties set the size of the white space outside the border.
	There are CSS properties for setting the margin for each side of an element:
	1) margin-top,
	2) margin-right,
	3) margin-bottom,
	4) margin-left.
		p { margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-right: 5px; margin-left: 8px; }
	The margin property is a shorthand property.
		p { margin: 10px 15px 10px 80px; }
	How it works:
	1) one value: all four margins have that value;
	2) two values: (top and bottom), (right and left);
	3) three values: top, (right and left), bottom;
	4) four values: top, right, bottom, left;
	You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.
		div { width: 300px; margin: auto; border: 1px solid red; }
	The margin may be inherited from the parent element.
		p.one { margin-left: inherit; }
	Note: Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins. This does not happen on horizontal margins (left and right)! Only vertical margins (top and bottom)!
padding
	The padding clears an area around the content (inside the border) of an element.
	There are CSS properties for setting the padding for each side of an element:
	1) padding-top,
	2) padding-right,
	3) padding-bottom,
	4) padding-left.
		p { padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 3px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 8px; }
	The padding property is a shorthand property.
		p { padding: 50px 30px 50px 80px; }
	How it works:
	1) one value: all four paddings are that value;
	2) two values: (top and bottom), (right and left);
	3) three values: top, (right and left), bottom;
	4) four values: top, right, bottom, left;
		div { padding: 25px 50px 75px; }
	inherit - specifies that the padding should be inherited from the parent element.
		p.one { padding-left: inherit; }
height and width
	The height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.
	The height and width can be set to auto (this is default. Means that the browser calculates the height and width), or be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block.
		div { height: 200px; width: 50%; background-color: powderblue; }
	Note: The height and width properties do not include padding, borders, or margins; they set the height/width of the area inside the padding, border, and margin of the element!
	The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.
		div { max-width: 500px; height: 100px; }
	Note: The value of the max-width property overrides width.
box model
	All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.
	The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.
		div { width: 300px; border: 25px solid green; padding: 25px; margin: 25px; }
	The total width of an element should be calculated like this: Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin
	The total height of an element should be calculated like this: Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin
outline
	The CSS outline properties specify the style, color, and width of an outline. An outline is a line that is drawn around elements (outside the borders) to make the element "stand out". However, the outline property is different from the border property - The outline is NOT a part of an element's dimensions; the element's total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.
	1. Outline Style
	The outline-style property specifies the style of the outline.
	It can have one of the following values: dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset, none, hidden.
		p { border: 1px solid black; outline-color: red; outline-style: double; }
	2. Outline Color
	The outline-color property is used to set the color of the outline. The color can be set by: name, RGB, Hex, invert - performs a color inversion (which ensures that the outline is visible, regardless of color background).
		p { border: 1px solid black; outline-style: double; outline-color: red; }
	3. Outline Width
	The outline-width property specifies the width of the outline. The width can be set as a specific size (in px, pt, cm, em, etc) or by using one of the three pre-defined values: thin, medium, or thick.
		p { border: 1px solid black; outline-style: double; outline-color: red; outline-width: thick; }
	4. Shorthand property
	The outline property is a shorthand property for the following individual outline properties:
	1) outline-width,
	2) outline-style (required),
	3) outline-color.
		p { border: 1px solid black; outline: 5px dotted red; }
text
	1. Text Color
	The color property is used to set the color of the text. The default text color for a page is defined in the body selector.
		body { color: blue; }
		h1 { color: green; }
	Note: For W3C compliant CSS: If you define the color property, you must also define the background-color.
	2. Text Alignment
	The text-align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text. A text can be left or right aligned, centered, or justified. When the text-align property is set to "justify", each line is stretched so that every line has equal width, and the left and right margins are straight (like in magazines and newspapers).
		h1 { text-align: center; }
		h2 { text-align: left; }
		h3 { text-align: right; }
		div { text-align: justify; }
	3. Text Decoration
	The text-decoration property is used to set or remove decorations from text. Values: none, overline, line-through, underline. The value text-decoration: none; is often used to remove underlines from links.
		a { text-decoration: none; }
	Note: It is not recommended to underline text that is not a link, as this often confuses the reader.
	4. Text Transformation
	The text-transform property is used to specify uppercase and lowercase letters in a text. It can be used to turn everything into uppercase or lowercase letters, or capitalize the first letter of each word. Values: uppercase, lowercase, capitalize.
		p.uppercase { text-transform: uppercase; }
		p.lowercase { text-transform: lowercase; }
		p.capitalize { text-transform: capitalize; }
	5. Text Indentation
	The text-indent property is used to specify the indentation of the first line of a text.
		p { text-indent: 50px; }
	6. Letter Spacing
	The letter-spacing property is used to specify the space between the characters in a text.
		h1 { letter-spacing: 3px; }
		h2 { letter-spacing: -3px; }
	7. Line Height
	The line-height property is used to specify the space between lines.
		p.small { line-height: 0.8; }
		p.big { line-height: 1.8; }
	8. Text Direction
	The direction property is used to change the text direction of an element.
		div { direction: rtl; }
	9. Word Spacing
	The word-spacing property is used to specify the space between the words in a text.
		h1 { word-spacing: 10px; }
		h2 { word-spacing: -5px; }
font
	In CSS, there are two types of font family names:
	1) generic family - a group of font families with a similar look (like "Serif" or "Monospace")
	a. Serif (Serif fonts have small lines at the ends on some characters);
	b. Sans-serif (These fonts do not have the lines at the ends of characters);
	c. Monospace (All characters have the same width);
	2) font family - a specific font family (like "Times New Roman", "Georgia", "Arial", "Verdana", "Courier New", or "Lucida Console")
	Note: On computer screens, sans-serif fonts are considered easier to read than serif fonts.
	1. Font Family
	The font family of a text is set with the font-family property.
	The font-family property should hold several font names as a "fallback" system. If the browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font, and so on. More than one font family is specified in a comma-separated list.
		p { font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif; }
	Note: If the name of a font family is more than one word, it must be in quotation marks, like: "Times New Roman".
	2. Font Style
	The font-style property is mostly used to specify italic text. This property has three values:
	1) normal
	2) italic
	3) oblique - The text is "leaning" (oblique is very similar to italic, but less supported)
		p.normal { font-style: normal; }
		p.italic { font-style: italic; }
	3. Font Size
	The font-size property sets the size of the text. The font-size value can be an absolute, or relative size.
	1) Absolute size:
	a. Sets the text to a specified size
	b. Does not allow a user to change the text size in all browsers (bad for accessibility reasons)
	c. Absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known
	2) Relative size:
	a. Sets the size relative to surrounding elements
	b. Allows a user to change the text size in browsers
	Note: If you do not specify a font size, the default size for normal text, like paragraphs, is 16px (16px=1em).
		p { font-size: 14px; }
	To allow users to resize the text (in the browser menu), use em instead of pixels. 1em is equal to the current font size. The default text size in browsers is 16px. So, the default size of 1em is 16px. The size can be calculated from pixels to em using this formula: pixels/16=em
		p { font-size: 0.875em; /* 14px/16=0.875em */ }
	The solution that works in all browsers, is to set a default font-size in percent for the <body> element:
		body { font-size: 100%; } p { font-size: 0.875em; }
	4. Font Weight
	The font-weight property specifies the weight of a font.
		p.normal { font-weight: normal; }
		p.thick { font-weight: bold; }
	5. Font Variant
	The font-variant property specifies whether or not a text should be displayed in a small-caps font. In a small-caps font, all lowercase letters are converted to uppercase letters. However, the converted uppercase letters appears in a smaller font size than the original uppercase letters in the text.
		p.normal { font-variant: normal; }
		p.small { font-variant: small-caps; }
hyperlink
	1. Styling Links
	Links can be styled with any CSS property (e.g. color, font-family, background, etc.).
		a { color: hotpink; }
	In addition, links can be styled differently depending on what state they are in. The four links states are:
	1) a:link - a normal, unvisited link
		a:link { color: red; }
	2) a:visited - a link the user has visited
		a:visited { color: green; }
	3) a:hover - a link when the user mouses over it
		a:hover { color: hotpink; }
	4) a:active - a link the moment it is clicked
		a:active { color: blue; }
	When setting the style for several link states, there are some order rules:
	1) a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited
	2) a:active MUST come after a:hover
	2. Text Decoration
	The text-decoration property is mostly used to remove underlines from links.
		a:link { text-decoration: none; }
	3. Background Color
	The background-color property can be used to specify a background color for links.
		a:link { background-color: yellow; }
	4. Link Buttons
	Several CSS properties must be combined to display links as boxes/buttons:
		a:link, a:visited { background-color: #f44336; color: white; padding: 14px 25px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; }
		a:hover, a:active { background-color: red; }
list
	In HTML, there are two main types of lists:
	1) unordered lists (<ul>) - the list items are marked with bullets
	2) ordered lists (<ol>) - the list items are marked with numbers or letters
	The CSS list properties allow you to:
	1) Set different list item markers for ordered lists
	2) Set different list item markers for unordered lists
	3) Set an image as the list item marker
	4) Add background colors to lists and list items
	1. List Item Markers
	The list-style-type property specifies the type of list item marker.
		ul.a { list-style-type: circle; }
		ul.b { list-style-type: square; }
		ol.c { list-style-type: upper-roman; }
		ol.d { list-style-type: lower-alpha; }
	The list-style-image property specifies an image as the list item marker.
		ul { list-style-image: url('sqpurple.gif'); }
	The list-style-position property specifies whether the list-item markers should appear inside or outside the content flow.
		ul { list-style-position: inside; }
	2. Shorthand property
	The list-style property is a shorthand property. It is used to set all the list properties in one declaration.
		ul { list-style: square inside url("sqpurple.gif"); }
	The order of the property values are:
	1) list-style-type (if a list-style-image is specified, the value of this property will be displayed if the image for some reason cannot be displayed)
	2) list-style-position (specifies whether the list-item markers should appear inside or outside the content flow)
	3) list-style-image (specifies an image as the list item marker)
	If one of the property values above are missing, the default value for the missing property will be inserted, if any.
	3. Styling List With Colors
	We can also style lists with colors, to make them look a little more interesting. Anything added to the <ol> or <ul> tag, affects the entire list, while properties added to the <li> tag will affect the individual list items.
		ol { background: #ff9999; padding: 20px; }
		ol li { background: #ffe5e5; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px; }
		ul { background: #3399ff; padding: 20px; }
		ul li { background: #cce5ff; margin: 5px; }
table
	1. Table Borders
	To specify table borders in CSS, use the border property.
		table, th, td { border: 1px solid black; }
	The border-collapse property sets whether the table borders should be collapsed into a single border.
		table { border-collapse: collapse; }
	For a border around the table, only specify the border property for <table>.
		table { border: 1px solid black; }
	2. Table Width and Height
	Width and height of a table are defined by the width and height properties.
		table { width: 100%; }
		th { height: 50px; }
	3. Alignment
	The text-align property sets the horizontal alignment (like left, right, or center) of the content in <th> or <td>. By default, the content of <th> elements are center-aligned and the content of <td> elements are left-aligned.
		th { text-align: left; }
	The vertical-align property sets the vertical alignment (like top, bottom, or middle) of the content in <th> or <td>. By default, the vertical alignment of the content in a table is middle (for both <th> and <td> elements).
		td { height: 50px; vertical-align: bottom; }
	4. Table Padding
	To control the space between the border and the content in a table, use the padding property on <td> and <th> elements.
		th, td { padding: 15px; text-align: left; }
	5. Horizontal Dividers
	Add the border-bottom property to <th> and <td> for horizontal dividers.
		th, td { border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; }
	6. Hoverable Table
	Use the :hover selector on <tr> to highlight table rows on mouse over.
		tr:hover { background-color: #f5f5f5 }
	7. Striped Tables
	For zebra-striped tables, use the nth-child() selector and add a background-color to all even (or odd) table rows.
		tr:nth-child(even) { background-color: #f2f2f2 }
	8. Table Color
	You can specify the background color and text color of <th> elements.
		th { background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; }
	9. Responsive Table
	A responsive table will display a horizontal scroll bar if the screen is too small to display the full content. Add a container element (like <div>) with overflow-x:auto around the <table> element to make it responsive.
		<div style="overflow-x:auto;"> <table></table> </div>
display
	The display property is the most important CSS property for controlling layout. It specifies if/how an element is displayed.
	Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.
	1. Block-level Elements
	A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
	Examples of block-level elements: <div>, <h1> - <h6>, <p>, <form>, <header>, <footer>, <section>
	2. Inline Elements
	An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
	Examples of inline elements: <span>, <a>, <img>
	3. Display: none;
	display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them. The <script> element use display: none; as its default.
	4. Override The Default Display Value
	Changing an inline element to a block element, or vice versa, can be useful for making the page look a specific way, and still follow the web standards.
		/* making inline <li> elements for horizontal menus */ li { display: inline; }
	Note: Setting the display property of an element only changes how the element is displayed, NOT what kind of element it is. So, an inline element with display: block; is not allowed to have other block elements inside it.
	5. Hide an Element - display:none or visibility:hidden?
	Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to none. The element will be hidden, and the page will be displayed as if the element is not there.
		h1.hidden { display: none; }
	visibility:hidden; also hides an element. However, the element will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but still affect the layout!
		h1.hidden { visibility: hidden; }
max-width
	A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). Setting the width of a block-level element will prevent it from stretching out to the edges of its container. Then, you can set the margins to auto, to horizontally center the element within its container. The element will take up the specified width, and the remaining space will be split equally between the two margins.
	Using max-width will improve the browser's handling of small windows. This is important when making a site usable on small devices.
		div.ex1 { width: 500px; margin: auto; border: 3px solid #73AD21; }
		div.ex2 { max-width: 500px; margin: auto; border: 3px solid #73AD21; }
position
	1. The position property
	The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
	There are four different position values: static, relative, fixed, absolute.
	1) position: static;
	HTML elements are positioned static by default. Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
		div.static { position: static; border: 3px solid #73AD21; }
	Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.
	2) position: relative;
	An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position. Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
		div.relative { position: relative; left: 30px; border: 3px solid #73AD21; }
	3) position: fixed;
	An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element. A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.
		div.fixed { position: fixed; bottom: 0; right: 0; width: 300px; border: 3px solid #73AD21; }
	4) position: absolute;
	An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed). However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
	Note: A "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static.
		div.relative { position: relative; width: 400px; height: 200px; border: 3px solid #73AD21; }
		div.absolute { position: absolute; top: 80px; right: 0; width: 200px; height: 100px; border: 3px solid #73AD21; }
	2. Overlapping Elements
	When elements are positioned, they can overlap other elements. The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others). An element can have a positive or negative stack order. An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
		img { position: absolute; left: 0px; top: 0px; z-index: -1; }
	Note: If two positioned elements overlap without a z-index specified, the element positioned last in the HTML code will be shown on top.
overflow 
	overflow property specifies whether to clip content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in a specified area.
	Note: The overflow property only works for block elements with a specified height.
	The overflow property has the following values: visible (default), hidden, scroll, auto.
	1) Visible. By default, the overflow is visible, meaning that it is not clipped and it renders outside the element's box.
		div { width: 200px; height: 50px; background-color: #eee; overflow: visible; }
	2) Hidden. With the hidden value, the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content is hidden.
		div { overflow: hidden; }
	3) Scroll. Setting the value to scroll, the overflow is clipped and a scrollbar is added to scroll inside the box. Note that this will add a scrollbar both horizontally and vertically (even if you do not need it).
		div { overflow: scroll; }
	4) Auto. The auto value is similar to scroll, only it add scrollbars when necessary.
		div { overflow: auto; }
	The overflow-x and overflow-y properties specifies whether to change the overflow of content just horizontally or vertically (or both):
	1) overflow-x specifies what to do with the left/right edges of the content.
	2) overflow-y specifies what to do with the top/bottom edges of the content.
		div { overflow-x: hidden; /* Hide horizontal scrollbar */ overflow-y: scroll; /* Add vertical scrollbar */ }
