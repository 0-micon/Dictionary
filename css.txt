Selectors
	1. The element Selector
		selects elements based on the element name.
		p { text-align: center; color: red; }
	2. The id Selector
		uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
	To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
		#para1 { text-align: center; color: red; }
	Note: An id name cannot start with a number!
	3. The class Selector
		selects elements with a specific class attribute.
	To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.
		.center { text-align: center; color: red; }
	You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.
		p.center { text-align: center; color: red; }
	HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.
		<p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>
	Note: A class name cannot start with a number!
	4. Grouping Selectors
	To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.
		h1, h2, p { text-align: center; color: red; }
Comments
	A CSS comment starts with /* and ends with */. Comments can also span multiple lines.
		p { color: red; /* This is a comment */ text-align: center; }
Insert CSS
	1. External Style Sheet
	A page must include a reference to the external CSS-file inside the <link> element. The <link> element goes inside the <head> section.
		<head><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css"></head>
	The CSS-file should not contain any html tags. The style sheet file must be saved with a .css extension.
	2. Internal Style Sheet
	Internal styles are defined within the <style> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page.
		<head><style>body { background-color: linen; }</style></head>
	3. Inline Styles
	To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
		<h1 style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;">This is a heading.</h1>
	Tip: An inline style loses many of the advantages of a style sheet (by mixing content with presentation). Use this method sparingly!
	4. Multiple Style Sheets
	If some properties have been defined for the same selector (element) in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used.
	Generally speaking we can say that all the styles will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:
	1) Inline style (inside an HTML element)
	2) External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
	3) Browser default
	So, an inline style (inside a specific HTML element) has the highest priority, which means that it will override a style defined inside the <head> tag, or in an external style sheet, or a browser default value.
Colors
	1. Color Names
	HTML and CSS supports 140 standard color names.
		http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp
	Note: Color names are case-insensitive: "Red" is the same as "red" or "RED".
	2. RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
	Each parameter (red, green, blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.
		rgb(255,255,0) is displayed as yellow
	3. Hexadecimal Colors
	RGB values are specified using hexadecimal color values in the form: #RRGGBB, where RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and FF (same as decimal 0-255).
		#FF0000 is displayed as red
	Note: HEX values are case-insensitive: "#ff0000" is the same as "FF0000".
Backgrounds
	1. Background Color
	The background-color property specifies the background color of an element.
		body { background-color: lightblue; }
	2. Background Image
	The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.
		body { background-image: url("paper.gif"); }
	By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element. To repeat an image vertically, set background-repeat: repeat-y; To show the background image only once, set background-repeat: no-repeat;
	The position of the image is specified by the background-position property.
		body { background-image: url("tree.png"); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: right top; }
	To specify that the background image should be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page), use the background-attachment property.
		body { background-image: url("tree.png"); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: right top; background-attachment: fixed; }
	To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property. The shorthand property for background is background.
		body { background: #ffffff url("tree.png") no-repeat right top; }
	When using the shorthand property the order of the property values is:
	1) background-color,
	2) background-image,
	3) background-repeat,
	4) background-attachment,
	5) background-position
	It does not matter if one of the property values is missing, as long as the other ones are in this order.
Borders
	1. Border Style
	The border-style property specifies what kind of border to display. The following values are allowed: dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset, none, hidden.
	When using the border-style property the order of the border sides is:
	1) one value: (top and right and bottom and left);
		p.one {border-style: dotted;}
	2) two values: (top and bottom), (right and left);
		p.two {border-style: dotted dashed;}
	3) three values: top, (right and left), bottom;
		p.three {border-style: dotted dashed solid;}
	4) four values: top, right, bottom, left.
		p.mix {border-style: dotted dashed solid double;}
	2. Border Width
	The border-width property specifies the width of the four borders. The width can be set as a specific size (in px, pt, cm, em, etc) or by using one of the three pre-defined values: thin, medium, or thick. The border-width property can have from one to four values (top, right, bottom, left).
		p.three { border-style: solid; border-width: 2px 10px 4px 20px; }
	3. Border Color
	The border-color property is used to set the color of the four borders. The border-color property can have from one to four values (top, right, bottom, left). If border-color is not set, it inherits the color of the element.
		p.three { border-style: solid; border-color: red green blue yellow; }
	4. Individual Sides
	In CSS, there is also properties for specifying each of the borders (top, right, bottom, and left): border-top-style, border-right-style, border-bottom-style, border-left-style.
		p { border-style: dotted solid; }
	5. Shorthand Property
	To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the individual border properties in one property. The border property is a shorthand property for the following individual border properties:
	1) border-width,
	2) border-style (required),
	3) border-color
		p { border: 5px solid red; }
	You can also specify all the individual border properties for just one side.
		p { border-left: 6px solid red; }
		p { border-bottom: 6px solid red; }
	6. Rounded Borders
	The border-radius property is used to add rounded borders to an element.
		p { border: 2px solid red; border-radius: 5px; }
Margins
	The margin properties set the size of the white space outside the border. There are CSS properties for setting the margin for each side of an element:
	1) margin-top,
	2) margin-right,
	3) margin-bottom,
	4) margin-left.
		p { margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-right: 5px; margin-left: 8px; }
	The margin property is a shorthand property.
		p { margin: 10px 15px 10px 80px; }
	How it works:
	1) one value: all four margins have that value;
	2) two values: (top and bottom), (right and left);
	3) three values: top, (right and left), bottom;
	4) four values: top, right, bottom, left;
	You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.
		div { width: 300px; margin: auto; border: 1px solid red; }
	The margin may be inherited from the parent element.
		p.one { margin-left: inherit; }
	Note: Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins. This does not happen on horizontal margins (left and right)! Only vertical margins (top and bottom)!
